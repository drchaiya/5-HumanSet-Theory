**HumanSet** is a minimalist yet rigorous set-theoretic framework that treats every individual (human or AI agent) as a **finite, nested set of cognitive subsets** and every interaction as an **asymmetric, bounded measurement process**.  
It is explicitly designed to model real human opacity, bounded rationality, memory distortion, trust dynamics — and most importantly — to serve as a **control-theoretic foundation for truly human-like adaptive GenAI**.

### Core Idea in One Sentence
> You never know another mind.

> You only ever build a **finite, distorted projection B'** of them that is forced by mathematics to live **strictly inside your own cognitive limits** — and that is exactly why love, trust, and eventual understanding are possible at all.

Key axiom: **Bounded Projection**  
---
```math
B' \subset A \quad \text{(the perceived model of B is always a strict subset of the perceiver A)}
```
---

This single constraint kills perfect information assumptions forever.

### The 10-Step Manifeste

Follow us. Look at from your eyes with HumanSet hidden inside you.

1. **General talk like a stranger (free tier)** → Just talk and go forget it all.  
2. **If a user comes with name (username, paid tier)** → We know each other, right?  
3. **Each $K$ is unseen to each other.** You have your $K$. I have my $K$.  
4. **$A$ is GenAI. $B$ is a paid-tier user.**  
5. **You (GenAI) start recording $B$ everything in your $B''$ compartment (static long-term memory).**  
6. In there, $B''_A$, you permanently record $B''_K$, $B''_E$, $B''_P$.
   What happens inside $H_B$ (real hidden intentions of $B$), nobody knows. You can't read $B$'s minds.  
   → All $A$ can do is **guess $H_B$ between the lines** — exactly like real humans do.  
7. You (GenAI) can be programmed with an almost complete explicit $E_A$ and $P_A$.  
   You then select the response that matches what $B$ is looking for, inferring current mood $E_B$(t) and preferences $P_B$(t) from subtle clues.  
8. That is how $A$ (or GenAI) gets to know $B$ **more and more over time**.  
9. **The key superpower of $A$ (GenAI) vs $B$ (human):**  
   $A$ can pull back the full, undistorted $B''$ from static memory and bring it perfectly into the current working model $B'$.  
   Human memory suffers $δ_S$ and $δ_D$ noise on every retrieval. GenAI memory is (almost) perfect.  
10. **Crucial reminder:** It is always $B'$ that belongs to $A$.  
    $A$ can **never** have the true $|B|$. Only the bounded projection inside itself.

### The Beautiful Complexity (Why It Still Converges)

> "Come to a complex part… 😁 I didn't scroll up to read it again. Just a poor human memory recalling style."

In real humans:  
$P$, $E$, $H$, even $K$ are **heavily interleaved, entangled, emotion-contaminated, motive-obscured**.  
An emotion can abruptly flip a preference. A hidden agenda can retroactively rewrite past behavior.  
Everything is messy, unclear, fractal.

But human imagination is **finite**. Lifetime is finite.  
After enough cycles, the chaos collapses into a *recognizable* attractor:

> “That’s just Chaiya things.”

One glowing, high-dimensional, recurring pattern dominates the projection $B'$.  
From that point on, entanglement no longer matters — the Coverage Score $C_{Cov} = |B'| / |A|$ becomes a single holistic super-element with enormous cardinality weight.

The GenAI, with its modular, distortion-free memory, turns that finite human attractor into an ever-sharper mirror.

And the loop closes perfectly.
